Hi,

I applied to two Master of Science programs today: The University of Texas at Austin and The Georgia Institute of Technology.

I wanted to track my progress somewhere so this is what I got.

Also, I just wanted a place to share my learnings on the subject of Artificial Intelligence as I do the work necessary to make that happen.

Best,
Tushar Kohli.
