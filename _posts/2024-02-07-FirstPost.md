Thoughts on using a Movie API.
- TMDB.
Use a graph and nodes to understand the social network of a particular movie or T.V. show.

For example, for the TV Yellowstone (which I am currently apparently obsessed with right now), you have the following:

                        John Dutton <-> Evelyn Dutton ðŸ’€ðŸª¦    James Randall <-> ? ðŸ’€
                                     |                                      | 
                                -----------                               Jamie
                              /      |      \
                        Lee ðŸ’€ðŸª¦    Beth    Kayce <-> Monica 
                                                  |
                                                 Tate

What if I could create this graph or map or network dynamically???

Is this even possible?

I mean, we would have to use the TMDB API
